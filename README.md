# 2D Graphics Engine: Vector-Reflection-Transformation

## Description

This is a simple 2D graphics engine built using Pygame. It demonstrates basic graphics programming concepts, including linear transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation) to manipulate objects on the screen.

## Features

- Render shapes (triangles, squares, etc.) on the screen.
- Apply transformations: translate, scale, and rotate shapes.
- Interactive user input to change transformation parameters.
- Simple animation capabilities (optional).

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project files):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
